# Find My Records - API

This respository contains all the different services that Find My Records currently supports. Each service will belong to a website and contains its own routes.

## üö¶ Routes

> GET /reference
```javascript
{
  params: {
    title: String,
    artists: String || Array,
  },
}
```

## ‚≠êÔ∏è CI/CD

We use both [CodeShip](https://codeship.com/) for CI and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) for CD.

When CodeShip is in charge of installing the dependencies, building the project with [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io/) and runs the tests with the delightful [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) testing framework, CircleCI is in charge of building the new Docker image at each commit and to push it to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/findmyrecords/dashboard/).

We then only need to upgrade the image in use by our services at DigitalOcean running `docker service update --image findmyrecords/service-juno service-juno` for instance.

## üíØ Code quality

For our code quality, we have chosen [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/). You can see the badge on top of this repository.

## üìë Logging

Since our environment is hosted in the cloud, we have chosen to use [Loggly](https://www.loggly.com/) for easily monitor our instances.
